      <h1> Hello everyone, my name is Thomas Boyle, and this is my web page! </h1>

<h2> About me: </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Thomas Boyle. Most of my friends call me TJ, Teej, or any clever spinoff of my name that they can come up with. I am a second year Information Technology major at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and have a concentration in Sociology. I reign from Jefferson Township, NJ, a quiet town with a bunch of cows. I am also a part of the Iota Beta chapter of the Kappa Delta Rho National Fraternity, and currently serve as the Junior Tribune for my chapter, also known as the new member educator. Along with that, I am able to hold down having two jobs on campus, one at Tech Crew preparing sound reinforcement and lighting design for events, and one as a notetaker for any deaf or hard of hearing students who happen to be in the same class as me. Just recently I got a new job at the Research Computing Department here at RIT, and am excited to use my technical skills to help further the research we are doing. </p>
